When deciding on what I wanted to do for this assignment I was originally very lost
as to what I wanted to do and what would be something that is enjoyable. I decided to
first select a platform to use which was out of Azure or AWS. This is because after 
some research they are the most popular cloud services, with AWS being far and away the 
most used. This  means that AWS is the platform I will focus on. From here I have to decide
on a service that will be widely useful. This has lead me to AWS Amplify, a service that makes
it easy to create a website and host it. I chose this because all companies that currently
exist or will in the future are going to need a functional website for their business.
Being able to do this through the cloud will mean more things can be kept in the AWS eco-system,
which will be easier to manage everything in one place. 

I have decided to follow the tutorial that can be found at the following link:
