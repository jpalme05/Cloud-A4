When deciding on what I wanted to do for this assignment I was originally very lost
as to what I wanted to do and what would be something that is enjoyable. I decided to
first select a platform to use which was out of Azure or AWS. This is because after 
some research they are the most popular cloud services, with AWS being far and away the 
most used. This  means that AWS is the platform I will focus on. From here I have to decide
on a service that will be widely useful. This has lead me to AWS Amplify, a service that makes
it easy to create a website and host it. I chose this because all companies that currently
exist or will in the future are going to need a functional website for their business.
Being able to do this through the cloud will mean more things can be kept in the AWS eco-system,
which will be easier to manage everything in one place. 

I have decided to follow the tutorial that can be found at the following link:
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/

The tutorial is split into a few different modules, and for each module I am going 
to write what I learned from completing it and if relevant what more I would like to 
learn in the future. Please keep in mind that this paper is being written as I complete
the project, so it will be chronological order.

I have now completed the first module. This module walked me through having a default
static page created using npx and npm and deploying it from a github account using 
AWS Amplify. This is the most basic website that can be deployed and the process is
very streamlined, AWS seems to do almost all of the work for the user including building
and deploying it on the cloud for you. Something I did not expect was how automated and simple
it was to have AWS connect and get permissions for the github, as now any changes to my master branch
on hithub will be reflected in the website.
